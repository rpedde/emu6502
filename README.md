# emu6502 #

An attempt to synthesize a custom 6502 machine by someone with no
business doing logic design.  Please close your eyes before looking at
this.

This utilizes the opencores T65 core, as modified by the FPGAArcade
folks, as well as some stuff USB debugging stuff from Xess
(http://www.xess.com), as it is targetted at a Xess XuLA-200.

Be aware, though, that this is NOT an example of How To Do It.
